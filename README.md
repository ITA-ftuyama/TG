TEEG - Translate Electroencefalography
======================================

TEEG is a Graduation Project (TG) that applies deeplearning concepts to translate raw EEG signals (using Neurosky Mindwave headsets) into commands to move a robotic arm.


## Python Mindwave - [Repo](https://github.com/akloster/python-mindwave)  

This is a library to interface with the Neurosky Mindwave headsets. It can
parse the binary protocol spoken by Neurosky's ThinkGear AM modules. These
modules are used in several headsets and board games, and development kits
are available from Neurosky.
